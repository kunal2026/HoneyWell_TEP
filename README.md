# üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on Anomaly Detection in the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP), a well-known industrial benchmark used for process control and fault detection research.

We implement multiple machine learning and deep learning models to detect anomalies in TEP sensor data, with options for fast approximate detection or accurate but computationally heavier detection.

The pipeline is modular and extensible, allowing you to:

Run anomaly detection using Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), One-Class SVM, PCA, Autoencoder (TensorFlow/Keras).

Select between Fast Mode (optimized for speed, still preserves feature importance length) and Accurate Mode (full evaluation across models).

Extract Top 7 contributing features per data entry explaining anomalies.

Save and visualize model results for further analysis.

```
# üöÄ Usage
The main script is models/run_algorithms.py.
It supports:

Modes: fast (speed) or accurate (full evaluation).

Models: choose one (isoforest, lof, svm, autoencoder, pca) or all.

Run:
```
python web/app.py
```

After that select:

    1. File
    2. Model
    3. Mode

    
Output
Top 7 anomaly features per entry as columns.

Anomaly scores + predictions saved in results/.
